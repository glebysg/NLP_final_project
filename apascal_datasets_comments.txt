For apascal dataset:

Total no. of classes : 20 + 12
No. of seen classes : 20
No. of unseen classes : 12
Size of feature vector : 12695

No. of instances of seen classes: 12694
No. of instances of unseen classes : 2643

Semantic description matrix S of seen classes (20 x 64)
Semantic description matrix S of unseen classes (12 x 64)
No. of descriptors : 64

Assuming there is no validation splits

N_train = 12694 . This number changes when we have validation splits.
X_train (12695 x 12694)
S_train (64 x 12694)

Testing is done on unseen classes.
N_test = 2643
X_test (12695, 2643)
S_test (64 x 2643)

seen_class_ids (20,) : We will never use it. It is a list of actual class ids  of seen classes. 
seen_attr_mat (20 x 64) : semantic description of the seen classes

unseen_class_ids (12,) : We will never use it. It is a list of actual class ids of unseen classes. 
unseen_attr_mat (12 x 64) : semantic description of the unseen classes
