Background:

Methodology:
  Explanation of SAE:
  Explanation about Datasets:
    * Apascal
    * Sun
    * Animals
  Algorithms:
    * SAE
    * SAE - PCA
    * SAE - RF
  Adding the regularizer and changing the math:
  Methods for tuning: Tuning heuristic

Experiments and Results:
  * Seen / Unseen Data splits
  * 10 fold cross validation [only on pca and rf]

Plots and Tables:
  * Table. x - all methods (regular, pca, rf) and all datasets (apy, anim, sun) : y - train, avg. valid, test acuracies, F1 scores.
  * Tuned lambda parameters for each dataset.
  * Tuned beta parameters for each dataset.

Problems/Issues:
  * Huge dataset that doesn't fit into the main memory
  * Understanding the preprocessed features. [Write the Chi square - ]
  * An extra pre processing step that is not described in the paper in the cited work. The dataset given for animals shows this thing.
